    """ Appends a post context to the given state machine. This process is very
        similar to sequentialization. There is a major difference, though:
       
        Given a state machine (e.g. a pattern) X with a post context Y, 
        a match is only valid if X is followed by Y. Let Xn be an acceptance
        state of X and Ym an acceptance state of Y: 

               ---(Xn-1)---->(Xn)---->(Y0)----> ... ---->((Ym))
                             store                       acceptance
                             input
                             position
        
        That is, it holds:

           -- The next input position is stored the position of Xn, even though
              it is 'officially' not an acceptance state.

           -- Ym will be an acceptance state, but it will not store 
              the input position!       

        The analysis of the next pattern will start at the position where
        X stopped, even though Ym is required to state acceptance.
